# 📊 Customer Churn Prediction

## 🔍 Project Overview
Customer churn prediction is a critical task for businesses aiming to improve customer retention.  
This project focuses on predicting whether a customer is likely to churn based on demographic, behavioral, and transactional features using machine learning techniques.

---

## 🎯 Project Goal
**Predict customer churn** to help the company take proactive actions and improve customer retention strategies.

---

## 🧠 Best Performing Model
- **Model:** Random Forest Classifier  
- **Reason:** Achieved the highest **F1-score**, providing a strong balance between precision and recall.

---

## 📈 Key Findings
- **Age**, **Payment Delay**, **Total Spend**, and **Support Calls** are among the most important features.
- Customers with **short tenure** and **low usage frequency** are more likely to churn.
- Proper **data preprocessing** (scaling and encoding) significantly improved model performance.
